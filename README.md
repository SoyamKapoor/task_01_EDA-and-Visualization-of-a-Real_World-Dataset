# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and insights related to survival rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, feature distribution analysis, correlation exploration, and result visualization using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task_01_EDA-and-Visualization-of-a-Real_World-Dataset.git
   cd task_01_EDA-and-Visualization-of-a-Real_World-Dataset
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   Make sure you have Python 3.12.8 and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```

3. **Launch the Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA_main.ipynb
   ```

4. **Explore the Analysis**
   - Follow each step in the notebook to see the data loading, cleaning, visualization, and insights process.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Load and Inspect Data
- Dataset loaded using Pandas
- Basic structure and data types reviewed

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values via **mean imputation**
- Removed duplicate rows
- Identified and discussed outliers using both statistical and visual methods

### 3. Data Visualization
- Created histograms for numerical features (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch)
- Bar plots for categorical variables like survival
- Correlation heatmap to assess relationships between features

### 4. Insights & Observations
- Passengers in higher classes had higher survival rates
- Fare amount showed a moderate positive correlation with survival
- Age and family relationships had limited influence
- Most numerical features are **right-skewed**
